<br>If there are any items from listed above, then make sure that you're subscribed to it and if you are then remove the .gma file from your addons folder and let Steam/Garry's Mod redownload the file.

sg_err_10 = You have both the Github version and the workshop version of cap_resources installed.<br>Please remove one of both by removing the cap_resources folder manually in your addon folder or by unsubscribing from the workshop collection.
sg_err_11 =[[ The custom fonts can not be found on your Garry's Mod Installation. Please download the following file from our site and make sure you've installed the files correctly:
<br>
<br><u>http://sg-carterpack.com/data/cap_fonts.zip</u>
<br>
<br>To install this, simply unzip the content by extracting the content with windows explorer or by pressing extract here with winrar, make sure you do not press extract to cap_fonts as that will create a folder within a folder! So double check that inside the folder there is an addon.txt and a resource file present.
<br>After it has been properly extracted place the cap_fonts folder inside “Steam\steamapps\COMMON\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons”
<br>After this you're good to go and have CAP fully Installed!
<br>
<br>The reason why you need to download these fonts separated is that the GMA workshop file type doesn't function with custom fonts which is a Steam/GMOD error which we as addon creators can't change or find a workaround for.
